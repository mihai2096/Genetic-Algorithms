# Genetic Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains all my projects related to Genetic Algorithms made during the second year of University. Genetic Algorithms have been one of my favorite subjects. Each homework has a documentation of what I have made. Shortly, I have learned about heuristic search algorithms (SAHC, NAHC, SA) and genetic algorithms. I have used them to solve multi-modal functions. In the homework 3, I've created an algorithms that aims to solve Travelling Salesman Problem using genetic algorithms.

### Dependencies

* C++ compiler

The bibliography for each homework is in it's documentation. However, I have mostly learned from my teacher [Eugen Croitoru](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~eugennc/)
